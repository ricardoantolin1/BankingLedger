# BankingLedger
My solution to the following code challenge (completed in around 4 hours): 

You have been tasked with writing the world’s greatest banking ledger. Please code a solution that can perform the following workflows through a console application (accessed via the command line):

-Create a new account
-Login
-Record a deposit
-Record a withdrawal
-Check balance
-See transaction history
-Log out

For additional credit, you may implement this through a web page. They don’t have to run at the same time, but if you would like to do that, feel free.

Use C# for the backend. If designing a front end, use whatever JavaScript frameworks/libraries you wish and just make sure they are included or available via NuGet. Please don't use persistent storage (e.g. SQL database)
